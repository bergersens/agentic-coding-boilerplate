# Test-Driven Development

## Philosophy

**Core principle**: Tests should verify behavior through public interfaces, not implementation details. Code can change entirely; tests shouldn't.

**Good tests** are integration-style: they exercise real code paths through public APIs. They describe _what_ the system does, not _how_ it does it. A good test reads like a specification - "user can checkout with valid cart" tells you exactly what capability exists. These tests survive refactors because they don't care about internal structure.

**Bad tests** are coupled to implementation. They mock internal collaborators, test private methods, or verify through external means (like querying a database directly instead of using the interface). The warning sign: your test breaks when you refactor, but behavior hasn't changed.

**Tautological tests** restate the implementation inside the assertion, so they pass by construction and give zero confidence. The expected value must come from an independent source of truth — a known-good literal, a worked example, the spec.

See [tests.md](tests.md) for examples and [mocking.md](mocking.md) for mocking guidelines.

## Anti-Pattern: Horizontal Slices

**DO NOT write all tests first, then all implementation.** This is "horizontal slicing" - treating RED as "write all tests" and GREEN as "write all code."

This produces **crap tests**:

- Tests written in bulk test _imagined_ behavior, not _actual_ behavior
- You end up testing the _shape_ of things rather than user-facing behavior
- Tests become insensitive to real changes

**Correct approach**: Vertical slices via tracer bullets. One test → one implementation → repeat.

```
WRONG (horizontal):
  RED:   test1, test2, test3, test4, test5
  GREEN: impl1, impl2, impl3, impl4, impl5

RIGHT (vertical):
  RED→GREEN: test1→impl1
  RED→GREEN: test2→impl2
  RED→GREEN: test3→impl3
```

## Workflow

### 1. Planning

- [ ] Confirm what interface changes are needed
- [ ] Confirm which behaviors to test (prioritize)
- [ ] Identify opportunities for deep modules (small interface, deep implementation)
- [ ] List the behaviors to test (not implementation steps)

Ask: "What should the public interface look like? Which behaviors are most important to test?"

### 2. Tracer Bullet

Write ONE test that confirms ONE thing about the system:

```
RED:   Write test for first behavior → test fails
GREEN: Write minimal code to pass → test passes
```

### 3. Incremental Loop

For each remaining behavior: RED → GREEN → repeat.

Rules:

- One test at a time
- Only enough code to pass current test
- Don't anticipate future tests
- Keep tests focused on observable behavior

### 4. Refactor

After all tests pass, look for [refactor candidates](refactoring.md):

- [ ] Extract duplication
- [ ] Deepen modules (move complexity behind simple interfaces)
- [ ] Run tests after each refactor step

**Never refactor while RED.** Get to GREEN first.

## Checklist Per Cycle

- [ ] Test describes behavior, not implementation
- [ ] Test uses public interface only
- [ ] Test would survive internal refactor
- [ ] Expected values are independent literals, not recomputed from the code
- [ ] Code is minimal for this test
- [ ] No speculative features added
