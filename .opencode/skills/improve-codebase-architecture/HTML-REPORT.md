# HTML Report Format

The architectural review is rendered as a single self-contained HTML file in the OS temp directory. Tailwind and Mermaid both come from CDNs.

## Header

Repo name, date, and a compact legend: solid box = module, dashed line = seam, red arrow = leakage, thick dark box = deep module. No introduction paragraph.

## Candidate card

Each candidate is one `<article>`:

- **Title** — short, names the deepening (e.g. "Collapse the Order intake pipeline").
- **Badge row** — recommendation strength (`Strong` = emerald, `Worth exploring` = amber, `Speculative` = slate), plus a dependency-category tag (`in-process`, `local-substitutable`, `ports & adapters`, `mock`).
- **Files** — monospaced list, `font-mono text-sm`.
- **Before / After diagram** — two columns side by side.
- **Problem** — one sentence. What hurts.
- **Solution** — one sentence. What changes.
- **Wins** — bullets, ≤6 words each. e.g. "Tests hit one interface", "Pricing logic stops leaking".

## Diagram patterns

Pick the pattern that fits. Mix them.

### Mermaid graph (workhorse for dependencies / call flow)

```html
<div class="rounded-lg border border-slate-200 bg-white p-4">
  <pre class="mermaid">
    flowchart LR
      A[OrderHandler] --> B[OrderValidator]
      B --> C[OrderRepo]
      C -.leak.-> D[PricingClient]
      classDef leak stroke:#dc2626,stroke-width:2px;
      class C,D leak
  </pre>
</div>
```

### Hand-built boxes-and-arrows (when Mermaid's layout fights you)

Modules as `<div>`s with borders and labels. Arrows as inline SVG.

### Cross-section (layered shallowness)

Stack horizontal bands to show layers a call passes through. Before: 6 thin layers. After: 1 thick band.

### Mass diagram (interface as wide as implementation)

Two rectangles per module — interface surface area vs implementation. Before: interface rectangle nearly as tall as implementation (shallow). After: short interface, tall implementation (deep).

## Style guidance

- Editorial, not corporate-dashboard. Generous whitespace.
- One accent colour (emerald or indigo) plus red for leakage and amber for warnings.
- Diagrams ~320px tall.
- `text-xs uppercase tracking-wider` for module labels — schematic, not UI.

## Vocabulary discipline

**Use exactly:** module, interface, implementation, depth, deep, shallow, seam, adapter, leverage, locality.

**Never substitute:** component, service, unit (for module) · API, signature (for interface) · boundary (for seam) · layer, wrapper (for module).

**Phrasings that fit the style:**

- "Order intake module is shallow — interface nearly matches the implementation."
- "Pricing leaks across the seam."
- "Deepen: one interface, one place to test."
- "Two adapters justify the seam: HTTP in prod, in-memory in tests."

Wins bullets name the gain in glossary terms. Don't write "easier to maintain" or "cleaner code".
